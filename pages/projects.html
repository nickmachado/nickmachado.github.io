      <p>This is my Grubs & Yums website. This is the first multi-page website I tried to create, as you can see it looks a little funky, but its a good reference point for me to see how far I've developed my programming skills. This site contains a total of Five pages, and they all link to each other through the navigation bar, I was very proud of it when it was finished.</p>

      <p>This is my Airbnb website. This was a lab project in class where we had to re-create multiple websites and this was the Airbnb page that we had to make off of a screenshot and this is what I managed to do. This was probably one of the hardest websites besides this one that I had to make.</p>

      <p>This is my Thaddeus Stevens website. This was also part of the lab project in class where we had to re-create multiple websites and this was the Thaddeus Stevens page. This was probably one of the easiest websites out of the whole group to build. </p>
